Demo

Installation

Clone the Repository (if hosted on a git platform):
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatsapp-clone.git
cd whatsapp-clone

Alternatively, download the project files as a ZIP and extract them.

Serve the Application:

The project is a static web app, so you can open index.html directly in a browser.
For development, use a local server to avoid CORS issues:npx http-server

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080.


Dependencies:

No external dependencies are required. All functionality is implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Ensure the background image (Yoriichi-Tsugikuni-Demon-Slayer-4K-Anime-Wallpaper-1081x608.jpg) is in the project directory or update the CSS to use a different image.
